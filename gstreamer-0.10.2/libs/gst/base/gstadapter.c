/**
 * SECTION:gstadapter
 * @short_description: adapts incoming data on a sink pad into chunks of N bytes
 *
 * This class is for elements that receive buffers in an undesired size.
 * While for example raw video contains one image per buffer, the same is not
 * true for a lot of other formats, especially those that come directly from
 * a file. So if you have undefined buffer sizes and require a specific size,
 * this object is for you.
 *
 * The theory of operation is like this: All buffers received are put
 * into the adapter using gst_adapter_push() and the data is then read back
 * in chunks of the desired size using gst_adapter_peek(). After the data is
 * processed, it is freed using gst_adapter_flush().
 *
 * For example, a sink pad's chain function that needs to pass data to a library
 * in 512-byte chunks could be implemented like this:
 * <programlisting>
 * static GstFlowReturn
 * sink_pad_chain (GstPad *pad, GstBuffer *buffer)
 * {
 *   MyElement *this;
 *   GstAdapter *adapter;
 *   GstFlowReturn ret = GST_FLOW_OK;
 *   
 *   // will give the element an extra ref; remember to drop it 
 *   this = MY_ELEMENT (gst_pad_get_parent (pad));
 *   adapter = this->adapter;
 *   
 *   // put buffer into adapter
 *   #gst_adapter_push (adapter, buffer);
 *   // while we can read out 512 bytes, process them
 *   while (#gst_adapter_available (adapter) >= 512 && ret == GST_FLOW_OK) {
 *     // use flowreturn as an error value
 *     ret = my_library_foo (#gst_adapter_peek (adapter, 512));
 *     #gst_adapter_flush (adapter, 512);
 *   }
 *   
 *   gst_object_unref (this);
 *   return ret;
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * For another example, a simple element inside GStreamer that uses GstAdapter
 * is the libvisual element.
 *
 * An element using GstAdapter in its sink pad chain function should ensure that
 * when the FLUSH_STOP event is received, that any queued data is cleared using
 * gst_adapter_clear(). Data should also be cleared or processed on EOS and
 * when changing state from #GST_STATE_PAUSED to #GST_STATE_READY.
 *
 * A last thing to note is that while GstAdapter is pretty optimized,
 * merging buffers still might be an operation that requires a memcpy()
 * operation, and this operation is not the fastest. Because of this, some
 * functions like gst_adapter_available_fast() are provided to help speed up
 * such cases should you want to.
 *
 * GstAdapter is not MT safe. All operations on an adapter must be serialized by
 * the caller. This is not normally a problem, however, as the normal use case
 * of GstAdapter is inside one pad's chain function, in which case access is
 * serialized via the pad's stream lock.
 *
 * Note that gst_adapter_push() takes ownership of the buffer passed.
