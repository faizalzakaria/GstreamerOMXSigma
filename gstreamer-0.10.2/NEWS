API added since 0.10.0:

      * GstNetTimeProvider::active
      * gst_base_src_set_format

Changes from the 0.8 series to 0.10 series:

      * Refcounting and API revised for thread safety, see rules in
        docs/design/part-MT-refcounting.txt

      * Scheduling is now done by the elements, they start/stop
        processing threads themselves. This removes the need for 
        a separate scheduler.

      * State changes now happen from sink to source. This makes sure
        that downstream elements are ready to process data when upstream
        starts producing.

      * EOS/ERROR/... does not change the state of elements anymore. This
        means that when the application sets the state on an element, it
        remains in this state.

      * GMainLoop integration. Information on the state of the pipeline
        is now received in the mainloop via the GstBus.

      * Events move separate from the datastream, this allows for both
        in and out of sync delivery of events.

      * Generic _pull() replaced by _pull_region() so that random access
        can be made faster.

      * data passing happens from PAUSED, called the preroll phase. In this
        state no data is rendered but it is queued in the sinks.

      * negotiation simplified. Caps are now attached to buffers and travel
        along with the datastream. 

      * GstBuffer is now subclassable.

      * Ghostpads now look and feel like real pads.

      * New Seeking/flushing policy.

      * Addition of base classes and helper functions in the core to abstract
        away the harder parts of plugin development.
